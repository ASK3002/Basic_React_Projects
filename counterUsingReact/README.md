# Counter Using React

This is a simple React project demonstrating a basic counter functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- Increments the counter when the "Add" button is clicked.
- Decrements the counter when the "Remove" button is clicked.
- Displays a message if the user tries to decrement the counter below `0`.

## ⚙️ Behavior

- Counter starts at `0`.
- When clicking "Add", the counter increases by `1`.
- When clicking "Remove":
  - If the counter is greater than `0`, it decreases by `1`.
  - If the counter is already at `0`, a red message is displayed:  
    **"Cannot reduce below zero!"**
